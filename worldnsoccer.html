    <h2>The FIFA World Cup</h2>
    <p>The most well-known worldwide soccer event has to be the FIFA World cup.
      Every four years, participating countries send a team of their best male
      players to compete in a tournament against other countries in order to win the
      title of world champion. The tournament is played in stages leading up to the
      final where the top two teams face off to win it all. To learn more, visit the
      <a href="https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/worldcup/index.html" target="_blank">
        FIFA World Cup</a> website.</p>
    <h2>The Olympics</h2>
    <p>The Olympics are the only other time in which the whole world competes in a
      tournament of soccer. Teams compete in the same way that they would in the
      World Cup, but the top 3 teams are the ones who go home with a prize. This
      of course, would be a bronze, silver, or gold medal. The Olympics are also
      the only time that the world's men <em>and</em> women play soccer against
      each other (in their gendered teams/events) at the same time.</p>
