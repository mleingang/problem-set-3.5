    <h1>Get Involved</h1>
      <p>Do you love soccer and want to know how you can get involved with the sport?
        There are a few easy ways to make an impact <em>and</em> have fun! Here you'll
        discover how you can potentially make soccer into a part-time job.</p>
    <h2>Coaching</h2>
      <p>The easiest way to get involved with soccer in your community is to coach a team.
      While coaching is a tough and time-consuming task, it can also be a fun experience.
      Coaches are essential to the success of a team, and if you want to help younger
      players shine, then becomming one might just be the perfect option for you!</p>
    <h3>Becomming a Coach</h3>
      <p>If you want to coach a team, you must first contact your local soccer club
       to find out if there are any open positions. If the club has a team without
       a coach, you may be asked to fill in this opening. But, if you know a group of
       potential players, you may also request to be their coach.</p>
    <h3>Improving your Coaching</h3>
        <p>Much like being a player, coaching requires a specific set of skills too.
          Coaches need to be patient with their players, as they are the ones teaching
          them how to play and how to improve their skils. </p>

    <h2>Refereeing</h2>
    <p>Refereeing is a good way to get more involved with soccer in your town if you want
      to make an extra buck. This sounds exciting, and it is, but it's important to understand
      the responsibility that comes with being a referee. Referees hold the authrity over <thead>
      game and must fairly enforce the rules of the game. It is a lot of work to be a good ref,
      but it's a good job for soccer lovers.</p>
    <p>If you want to become a referee, you may discover useful resources on the
      <a href="https://www.ussoccer.com/referees" target="_blank">US Soccer</a> website.</p>
    <p>Put shortly, there are 4 steps to becomming a referee.</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="steps">Contact your local soccer board. Ask if your town needs more referees and look for
        opportunities elsewhere if not. This is important, because you want to be able to put
        your skills to work once you complete the requirements to become a ref.</li>
      <li class="steps">Sign up for a class. If you want to become a referee, you'll have to get certified.
        This certification ensures that you have complete knowledge of the rules of soccer,
        and shows coaches that you are qualified to be refereeing their games.</li>
      <li class="steps">Once you pass your test, you'll have to acquire the proper equipment. This can
        also be found on the US Soccer website. This equipment includes a proper uniform
        and items that will help you maintain authority over the game.</li>
      <li class="steps">You may want to become a higher grade referee if you feel as though you have the
        right skills. To do this, you'll have to take additional classes for each level
        you wish to advance to.</li>
    </ol>
