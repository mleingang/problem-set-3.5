    <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
      <p>As with any other sport, there are plenty of rules to follow in soccer.
        These rules aim to make gameplay fair, and to keep players safe.The most
        important thing to know about soccer is that players are not allowed to use
        their hands to control the ball. The aim of the game is to score a point
        by getting the soccer ball in the opposing team's goal. To do this, players
        can use any body part (except for hands, of course!).Visit the
        <a href="http://www.theifab.com/laws" target="_blank">International Football
          Association Board</a> website for the full list of rules.</p>
