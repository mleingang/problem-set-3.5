<h2>Positions</h2>

  <h3>Offense</h3>
    <p>In most situations, offensive players are the ones who score the
      goals for their team. As exciting, and perhaps even simple, as this
      may sound, there are actually many skills required to be a successful
      attacker.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced levels of ball control</li>
      <li>Good understanding of proper positioning</li>
      <li>Powerful shot</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Advanced levels of ball control are what really set great offensive
      players from good ones. Great offensive players are able to make the
      ball do their bidding, giving them an advantage against opposing
      defenders. In addition, ball control helps the offensive player keep
      the ball in his or her team's possesion.</p>
    <p>It is important for all players to understand proper positioning, but
      positioning is especially useful to offenive players. When attempting
      to score a goal, fowards need to work together to get around the
      defense and goalkeeper. Positioning allows them to know where on the
      field they will be most useful to the other fowards in their attempt
      to score a goal.</p>
    <p>The most obvious, and arguably most imprtant skill that a foward must
      have is a powerful shot. Since these players are usually the ones
      scoring the goals for the team, they must have the ability to do so.
      The stronger a player's shot, the more difficult it is for the
      goalkeeper to make a save, making them more likely to score.</p>
  <h3>Midfield</h3>
    <p>Midfield is another one of the standard positions in soccer. A
      midfielder's job is to bridge the gap between the offense and defense.
      This means that players in this position must pull a lot of weight
      in order for their team to be successful. Some of the most important
      characteristics of a good midfielder are as follows.
    <ul>
      <li>Ball control</li>
      <li>Passing abilities</li>
      <li>Stamina</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just like attackers, midfielders also need to have decent ball control in
      order to effectively move the ball from the defense to the offense. Good ball
      control helps with being able to deliver accurate passes to teammates all
      over the field. Accurate and unpredicatble passes allow midfielders to control
      the field and keep the ball in their team's posession.</p>
    <p>Because midfielders have to bring the ball from the defense to the attackers,
      they are required to do a whole lot of running. This means that in order to
      be a successful midfielder, you have to have killer stamina.</p>
  <h3>Defense</h3>
    <p>Defense is arguably the most important position in soccer. Many amature coaches
      make the mistake of putting all of their "best" players on attack. However, if you
      think about it, defending your own goal is more important than scoring them. You can
      still tie a game (meaining you didn't win <em>or</em> lose) if your team doesn't
      score any goals (0 - 0). However, if your goal is left undefended or badly
      defended, you are more likely to lose, as it is harder to score goals than prevent
      them. This being said, it is important to understand that a solid defense is crucial
      to a winning team.</p>
    <p>As with any other position, being a defender requires specialized skills.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ball control</li>
      <li>Powerful kick</li>
      <li>Understanding of positioning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every position requires some level of ball control, but defenders require a
      different execution of the same skills that an attacker or midfielder would use.
      Defenders need to withstand the jukes of an opposing attacker and know when it is
      safe to stoop in and steal the ball.</p>
    <p>Above all positions, it is important for defenders to understand the importance of
      proper positioning, especially when it comes to defending an attack. Opposing
      offensive players are likely to be passing the ball in order to keep your defense
      guessing, so it is imporant to understand where you should be on the field in
      order to successfully block an attack. If players bunch up or move out of position,
      an opportunity to breach the defences may appear.</p>
  <h3>Goalkeeper</h3>
    <p>There is one exception to the no-hands rule. Goalkeepers
    are the teams' last defense when it comes to protecting the goal from an
    attacker's attempt to score a goal, which would allow them to gain a point for their
    team. This is what makes the goalkeeper so important. </p>
